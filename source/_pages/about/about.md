#### Hello and welcome to the Eagle Rex Cycling Club

Eagle Rex is a friendly and diverse cycling club, founded in 2021 and based in London, UK

The club is open to everyone who wants to gradually return to regular exercise, stay active, keep fit, support their own health, well-being and remain in good shape.

Whether it's road cycling, indoor cycling, mountain biking, BMX, cyclocross, tandem cycling, track there are endless options for fun-filled fitness adventures.

We offer a wide range of rides, including numerous weekly club rides, training rides, club open events, and cycling trips.

Our aim is to inspire you to help achieve your goals - whatever they might be.

Please ensure to give a Ride On to our fellow Zwifters to cheer them on and use our tag [EAGLEREX] after your name.
